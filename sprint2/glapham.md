# Sprint 2

Gabe Lapham, glapham, DnDBetter

## What I Planned To Do

- [#39](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/39)
- [#40](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/40)
- [#41](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/41)

## What I Did Not Do
- I did pretty much everything I set out to do, besides making a singular CSS file for the entire project (but Tyler set out to do that himself, so I don't feel too bad about it).

## What Problems I Encountered
- Reformatting the stats page with different positions to make sure it worked for all resolutions.
- Combine all of the frontend/backend folders/files to form interconnectivity.

## Issues I Worked On
- [#39](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/39) Making sure the stats page works for all resolution types
- [#40](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/40) Stats page editable text boxes and CSS uniformity
- [#41](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/41) Switching between pages

## Files I Worked On
- app/src/App.css
- app/src/App.jsx
- app/src/index.css
- app/src/frontend/Stats_Page/src/Stats.css
- app/src/frontend/Stats_Page/src/Stats.jsx
- app/src/frontend/Stats_Page/src/StatsApp.css
- app/src/frontend/Stats_Page/src/StatsApp.jsx

## What I Accomplished
Overall, I managed to correct some of the mistakes I had made with the display of the stats page by editing the elements in the CSS files, added more functionality to the stats page by adding in the text boxes, and created a navigation bar for the entire website so the user can traverse through each page.
