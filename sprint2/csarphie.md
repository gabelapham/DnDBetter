# Sprint 2

Cooper Sarphie, csarphie, DnDBetter

## What I Planned To Do

-[#9](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/9)

## What I Did Not Do
- I did not get the database fully connected to the backend, as I was having trouble getting it to connect, but I have the db set up to where the login system works on a local db so now I just have to figure out how to get it to connect

## What Problems I Encountered
- getting the backend of our page to connect with the db that I set up

## Issues I Worked On
- [#9](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/9) setting up backend db for user login and data saving


## Files I Worked On
- Created new react app to try and get the database to work without messing with the pages that were already created
- ./MySqlApp

## What I Accomplished
I set up our database so the other members can upload all the data that needs to be saved on it, and I have the base code for the login system although it is non functional due to being unable to connect with the db from the backend
