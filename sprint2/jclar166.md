## What I did not do
I achieved all of my assigned issues, and accomplished all I set out to do.

## What problems I encountered
- Wikidot class infor not being well organized
- Wikidot fighter info specifically containing elements outside of DND's basic ruleset, meaning I instead used [5esrd.org](https://5thsrd.org/character/classes/fighter/)
to scrape fighter information

## Files I worked on
/DNDBetter/app/src/backend/class-scraping/main.py

## What I accomplished
I was able to scrape the final nine classes from the player's handbook, and was also able to make the previously scraped information for barbarian, bard, and cleric
neater and more accurate.
Our class scraping pandas dataframe is now complete, with the potential for minor changes to be made in the event that databasing the information with sql calls for it.
