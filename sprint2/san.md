## Accomplishments

- I have worked on the frontend portion of User Character Background Information file.
- Made specific locations and positions for user input and made the text boxes to have nextline feature for user to put in their information as much as they want in the formatted box. Also worked on image box where user can input and replace the image they upload from thier side to website. After that, I worked on making text boxes and formatting of the page. The character background page is soild and finished, but might enhance if there is any good idea in future.
- For Sprint 3, We are planning on connecting the backend and frontend together and being able to use the allow user to use data from the database(backend) My task will be helping Frank to scrap the data for the spell page and once backend is finished help connecting and join finalizing the website.
- Overall. I have complited all assigned work.
