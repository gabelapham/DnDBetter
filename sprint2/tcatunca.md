# Sprint 2
Tyler Catuncan, tylerjcatuncan, DNDBetter

## What I planned to do
- [#62](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/62) Expand upon landing page
- [#63](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/63) Formalize CSS between some of the front end pages 
- [#64](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/64) Establish a theme for the website so that it looks the same in both light and dark mode

## What I did not do
I achieved all of my assigned issues, and accomplished all I set out to do.

## What problems I encountered
- I initialially wanted to do more work with standardizing the CSS between the pages, but I found that the way they were created posed a number of challenges
- One page used the needed png as a background rather than including it on the webpage via the img tag
- Another utilized a different type of text box implementation that conflicted with the themeing of the first while also posing other problems

## Issues I worked on
- Expand upon landing page [Issue 62](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/62)
- Formalize some of the CSS between the frontend pages [Issue 63](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/63)
- Create a standard theme for the webpage [Issue 64](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/64)

## Files I worked on

- /DNDBetter/app/src/frontend/Background_Page/src/ImageComponent.css
- /DNDBetter/app/src/frontend/Background_Page/src/ImageComponent.jsx

- /DNDBetter/app/src/frontend/Spell_Page/src/components/FunctionalCounter.css
- /DNDBettr/app/src/frontend/Spell_Page/src/components/FunctionalCounter.jsx

## What I accomplished
I managed to accomplish my goal of beginning the process of standardizing the CSS between the frontend pages. This has been a particularly daunting task,
especially since the CSS between the pages tended to conflict when the frontend pages were first merged together. While not yet fully complete, I've managed
to make some good headway and can have it fully done by the end of the next sprint. 
I also managed to help formalize the look of the webpage between different browsers and window sizes. As well, I've ensured that the webpage looks the same
regardless of the browser or computer theme. This ensures that the webpage looks the same for everyone working on it, which should allow us to better work
together on the website to ensure that it looks uniform and cohesive.
