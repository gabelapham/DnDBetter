# How To Run main.py
1. Download main.py and open it in a Python compatible IDE (PyCharm is recommended).
2. If the IDE says the file contains any errors, open the IDE's terminal and run the commands `pip install requests` and `pip install bs4`.
3. Use the IDE's run command, and the information on Barbarian features from wikidot 5e will printed to the console. <br>
(There's quite a lot of information, so I recommend expanding your console's display size)

This program is an example of how we will gather information from wikidot for class feature data, which will then be stored in a database that the website can query. Though it is not represented in main.py, I have also begun learning Pandas so that we can database our information
