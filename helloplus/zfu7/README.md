# React and Vite

to use react you just have to make sure node.js is installed, and you can create web dev projects and test it on your locals through vite.

vite terminal commands to set up a project:
- npm create vite@latest
- input project name
- select framework and language
- npm install in project directory to install dependency
- npm run dev: to run web server on local host

some items in provided template by Vite
- node_modules: where installed libraries are located
- public folder: where assets such as images or videos are placed
- .jxs files: javascript react component file containing components of the website
- index.html: contains entry point to our project
- package.json: contains info about the project, project name, version, dependency, etc..

The program consists of mostly provided code structure but with replaced elements. I added a simple navigation bar at the top with some links to the official DND web page. the program can be run with the "npm run dev" command on the terminal with all the files.
