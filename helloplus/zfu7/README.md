# React and Vite

to use react you just have to make sure node.js is installed, and you can create web dev projects and test it on your locals through vite.

vite termianl commands to set up a project:
- npm create vite@latest
- input project name
- select framework and language
- nmp install in project directory to install dependency
- npm run dev: to run web server on local host

some items in provided template by Vite
- node_modules: where installed libraries are located
- public folder: where asset such as images or videos are placed
- .jxs files: javascript react component file containing component of the website
- index.html: contain entry point to our project
- package.json: contain info about project, project name, version, dependency, etc..

The program consist of mostly provided code structure but with replaced elements. I added a navigation bar at the top with some links to the official DND web page. the program can be ran with the "npm run dev" on localhost with the files.
