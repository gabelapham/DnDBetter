# Website Header Component

This is a simple React website. 
It includes a title and a navigation menu with links. 
This component can be used as part of a larger React application to create a consistent header across different pages.

## How to Run

To use this component in your React project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `Header.js` file into your project's component directory.
2. Import the `Header` component in your application where you want to display the header.
3. Render the `Header` component in your application's JSX.

Here's an example of how to import and use the `Header` component in your code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Header from './path/to/Header';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Header />
      {/* Other components and content */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
