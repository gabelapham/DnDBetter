## Accomplishments
I'm honestly very proud of the work that I've accomplished here. I managed to get the character sheet on screen, with each individual character stat editable for
the user via the increment/decrement buttons. The saving throws, skills, initiative, and passive perception are all affected by the editable stats, and update
in real time. The level drop-down also affects the skills/saving throws due to the proficiency bonus changing via code that I made, and the checkboxes next to the
skills/saving throws allow the user to select which items the character is proficient in. I also added in some editable text boxes for the player name and the
character name, because I forgot that I wasn't the one who was supposed to do that, but I just left it in since there wasn't much of a point in taking them out.
