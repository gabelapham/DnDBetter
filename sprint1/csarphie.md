# Sprint 1
Cooper Sarphie, csarphie, DnDBetter

## What I planned to do
- Creating login page

## What I did not do
I did not get the backend functionality working during the first sprint

## What problems I encountered
- learning react
- relearning html and css and stuff, as well as figuring out the backend
- getting the login page to show up and getting the react page to load

## Issues I worked on
- create a login page

## Files I worked on
All files are located in ./frontend/Login_page, with the main files I worked on being:
- ./src/App.js
- ./src/index.css
- ./src/main.js

## Accomplishments
I should have been able to get the login page functioning, but due to poor time managment and some circumstances out of my control, i was unable to finish it. I have had to learn all the code for this sprint pretty much from scratch as I have never made a login page or used react before, however I did manage to get a basic page set up and I will be able to complete the account system before the end of the next sprint
