# Sprint 1

Tyler Catuncan, tcatunca, DnDBetter

### What you planned to do
- #24 Create buttons to other pages
- #28 Create landing page
- #30 Scrape Cleric class data

### What you did not do
- I did manage to finish my assigned issues, though I would've liked to get more work done on each of the individual pages, which was the plan of our original sprint meeting. 

### What problems you encountered
- Most of my issues came from the fact that I wanted to complete specific features for pages that weren't complete yet. This meant that I had to wait to actually begin doing my work, during which I helped the backend people with some of the data scraping in the interim. 

### Issues you worked on
- #24 Create buttons to other pages
- #28 Create landing page
- #30 Scrape Cleric class data
