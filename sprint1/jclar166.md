# Sprint 1
Jonathan Clark, JonClark28, jclar166

## What I planned to do
- Scraping the barbarian class information https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/26
- Scraping the bar class information https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/27
- Databasing the class information with pandas https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/29

## What I did not do
I achieved all of my assigned issues, but I personally would have liked to have gotten the subclasses scraped as well.
However, I did not have enough time to do so and will instead make it an issue for sprint 2.

## What problems I encountered
- Wikidot class info not being well organized (all contained under a single div)
- Learning how to use pandas, specifically to concat to dataframes
- Learning how to use beautiful soup for web scraping

  ## Issues I worked on
- Scraping the barbarian class information. Issue [26] (https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/26)
- Scraping the bar class information. [Issue 27] (https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/27)
- Databasing the class information with pandas. [Issue 29] (https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/29)

## Files I worked on
- /DNDBetter/backend/class-scraping/main.py

## What I accomplished
I was able to scrape all of the main information for the first three classes in the Player's Handbook (barbarian, bard, cleric).
I was then able to store this information in a pandas dataframe, and print said dataframe to ensure everything was scraped and
stored correctly. The only data I have not scraped/stored for the first three classes are their subclasses and their spell slots/levels.
