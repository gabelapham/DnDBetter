planned to do
- issue #15 create the spells web page
- issue #17 allow user to input spell information
- issue #18 the spell slot management function which allow user to control number of spells of each level

what I did not do
- the spell slot management function can be improved where spell information can only be added if it's within the slot alloted range
- create function to indicate spell preparation

problems encountered
- set the spell page content so that if window browser becomes too little it doesn't affect the position of the content

issues worked on
- issue #15
- issue #17
- issue #18

File worked on
- ./DnDBetter/Spell_Page/src/components/FunctionalCounter.jsx
- ./DnDBetter/Spell_Page/src/components/Navbar.jsx
- ./DnDBetter/Spell_Page/src/components/SpellBackground.jsx
- ./DnDBetter/Spell_Page/src/components/SpellLog.jsx

- ./DnDBetter/Spell_Page/src/components/SpellLog.css

I worked on the set up the of the spell page, allowing user to input and manage basic information of their spells, but it could still be improved upon so that there's more content within the page. The styles could also be worked on so that it's not as bland.
