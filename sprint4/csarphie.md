# Sprint 3
Cooper Sarphie, csarphie, cooperalpaca

## What I planned to do
- add the functionality on all pages for when the user is logged in or not logged in

## What I did not do
- I achieved most of my assigned issues, aside from being able to save the user created character sheets, but the pages are all responsive to whether or not the user is logged in or not, so it should be easy to add saving functionality.

## What problems I ecnountered
- I do not know what data needs to be saved or in what format it should be in, so I will need to figure that out

## Issues I worked on
- - [#9](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/9) setting up backend db for user login and data saving
- -  [#90](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/90) add functionaliity based on login state to all pages
- -  [#91](https://github.com/gabelapham/DnDBetter/issues/91) add ability to save created sheets
  
## Files I worked on
- app/src/App.jsx
- app/src/frontend/Background_Page/src/app.jsx
- app/src/frontend/Landing_Page/src/App.jsx
- app/src/frontend/Spell_Page/src/SpellApp.jsx
- app/src/frontend/Stats_Page/src/StatsApp.jsx

## What I accomplished
I added functionality to check the state of the login token for each page, so on the character sheet pages, the save button appears, on the landing page, the logout button appears, etc. I also began adding the saving fucntionality but it needs a lot more work before it is functional
