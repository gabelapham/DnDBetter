## Accomplishments

- I have worked on the frontend portion, which are Stats page, Spell page, and Background page.
- I implemented the dice roller function that enables the user to click on a button that displays the various types of dice and the results of the dice (if user clicks on the different dice it displays the result)
- I cleanded out the code and made the background page neater by making text boxes' border transparent and fit to the visuals.
- For Sprint 4, Our group will finalize the pages and implement the functions that are connected to the backend portion.
