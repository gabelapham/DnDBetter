planned to do
- issue #67 set spell content so that it would be depended of the stats page
- issue #68 scrape and store spell attribute and description into the data base
- issue #69 set up the spell selection page and be able to pull data from the data base to display to the user

what I did not do
- I have yet to finish setting up the api for pulling data from the data base for frontend functionality

problems encountered
- I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to upload a panda data frame into mysql database before I changed my approach and resolved it
- encountered problem with storing data from database into state variables

issues worked on
- issue #67
- issue #68
- issue #69

I worked on scraping rest of data and uploading it into the database. I worked on frontend spell selection menu and completed basic functionality.
I worked on setting up server and connect front and backend to pull information, but it's still in working progress
