# DnDBetter
Our project is an interactive, web-based Dungeons & Dragons character sheet that can be easily created, edited, saved, and used during the user's own game sessions. It will be an easy, quick, and reliable way to reference your own's characters stats without having to keep up with a piece of paper every time you want to play.
